# Flight-Fare-Web-App-with-PricePrediction


A Web App that helps to predict the price of the Airplane based on the the destination date, travel day, source, destination and which flight the user prefers.

I have used The Random Forest model with hyperparameter tuning which gave me the best results for the predictions.

My app Looks like this on the front page which has been made using flask framework, and gives the prediction of the price after the prediction.
